# Analog-Solar-Tracker
Design and implementation of a single-axis automatic solar tracker aimed at maximizing
photovoltaic energy generation using optimized panel orientation. Due to maximum electrical
output of a solar panel depending heavily on the angle of incidence and intensity of sunlight,
a dynamic tracking system is required to maintain high efficiency under varying environmen-
tal conditions. This system fully employs a purely analog PID control circuit, made using
OPAMPs and discrete electronic components to continuously observe the sunlight and change
the direction and rotate the solar panel accordingly. All circuitry was simulated using LT-
Spice and subsequently validated using breadboard testing as well. A complete PCB design
was done using Altium Designer following JLCPCB’s manufacturing guidelines, and me-
chanical integration is done using 3D printing using models done on SOLIDWORKS. The
final implementation demonstrates a reliable and responsive analog system for enhanced solar
energy harvesting.
